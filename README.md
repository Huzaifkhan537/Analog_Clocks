# Analog_Clocks

In this Project i have used pure HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT to create different types of Analog Clocks ,
In the first type I made all the second, minute and hour hand inside a single clock and given a hover effect to the clock and for the Second type I made second hand and min hour hands seperate to look Interesting,
Hope you find it Innovative!
